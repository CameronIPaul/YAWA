Yet Another Weather App

The android application, when started, is run by typing a city name (currently limited to New Zealand cities) into the text input,
and clicking the search icon on the keyborad, this will look up the specified city using the open weather maps API.
Having searched for a city clicking on any given day (including its data) will show more information about the selected day in a
seperate activity.
